CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Answer:Information Architecture(IA) is the practice of organizing, structing, and labeling content on a wedsite in an effective and sustainable way.It focuses on making information easy to find and understand,through clear navigation, categorization,and hierarchy, ensuring users can intuitively locate what they need.
2. What is a "Wireframe”?
Answer:A wireframe is a low-fidelity, skeletal blueprint or visual layout of a webpage.It outlines the basic structure,placement of elements(e.g.,headers,navigation,content areas,),and user flow without including colors,images, or detailed design-focusing solely on functionality and arrangement.

3. Explain the concept of ”Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Answer:Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort or resistance users experience when trying to understand or navigate a website.It occurs due to confusing layouts,unclear labels, excessive options, or unexpected behaviors,leading to frustrattion,higher bounce rates,and poor user experience.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Answer:Search engines like Google treat hyphens(-)as word separators,interpreting "best-practices" as "best practices" for better keyword relevance and SEO ranking.Underscores(_)are treated as connectors, so "best_practices"is read as one word ("bestpractices"), reducing readability and SEO effectiveness.Hyphens also improve human readability in URLs.

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.
Give an example of when to use each.

Answer:Hierarchical(Tree) structure:Organizes content in a top-down tree like format with a home page as the root,branching into main categories and sub-categories.It supports deep navigation with multiple levels.
Advantages
-Scalable for large sites
-Intuitive for broad-t0-specific browsing
-Good for complex information

Disadvantages
-Can lead to deep nesting
-making lower pages harder to reachable
Examples:Use Hierarchical for a university website (Home → Departments → Courses → Specific Course Details) to allow flexible browsing.

Linear(Sequential)Structure:Organizes pages in a strict step-by-step order,forcing users to follow a fixed path(e.g.,net/previous buttons).
Advantages
-controls user flow
-simple to implement

Disadvantages
-Restrictive
-poor for non-linear eploration
-high frustration if users want to skip steps.
Examples:Use Linear for a guided process like an online checkout wizard or tutorial (Step 1: Cart → Step 2: Shipping → Step 3: Payment).

6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.

Answer:The Three-Click Rule is a guideline stating that users should be able to find any information on website in no more than three clicks(or interactions)from the home page.
       Significance in UX:It promotes efficicent navigation,reduces cognitive load and frustration,lowers bounce rates,and improves satisfaction and conversion rates.While not a strict rule(modern studies show users tolerate more clicks if navigation is clear),it encourages flat hierarchies,strong IA,intuitive menus,and effective search functionality to ensure quick access to content.

7. ”Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
Answer:Effective planning prevents rework and ensures user-centered design.
Card Sorting:A user research technique where participants group content topics(written on cards)into categories.It reveals how real users mentally organize information,helping create intuitive navigation labels,hierarchies,and menus that match user expectations.
Flowcharts:Visual diagrams showing user journeys,page connections,decision points,and navigation paths.They map out site structure,identify dead ends or loops,and ensure logical flow-helping designers visualize complexity,optimize paths,and align with business/user goals before development begins.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions,Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough diagram and justify your choice.

Answer:I would choose Hierarchical(Tree)structure model.A university site has diverse content with natural categories and sub-categories.Hierarchical structure scales well for hundreds of pages,allows intuitive browsing(broad to  specific),supports clear navigation menus(eg.,dropdowns),improves findability via breadcrumbs,and accomodates growth(eg.,adding new departments).Alternatives like linear would restrict exploration,while pure flat structure would overwhelm the main menu.
Home
 ├─ Admissions
 ├─ Departments
 │   ├─ IT
 │   ├─ Management
 ├─ Alumni
 ├─ News
 Conclusion:
 Handles large amount of content
 Easy navigation
 Clear categorization
 Scalable for future growth


9. Auser visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.

Answer:This is a clear violation of the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle, which emphasizes simplicity to avoid unnecessary complexity.

Analysis: Hiding the primary navigation behind a small hamburger icon (common on mobile) on a large desktop screen adds unnecessary steps—users must first notice, understand, and click the icon to reveal the menu. This creates cognitive friction, delays task completion, and frustrates users expecting visible, traditional navigation bars.

The design over-prioritizes minimalism/aesthetics over usability, assuming users are familiar with mobile patterns on desktop. Result: High bounce rate.
Better approach: Use a visible horizontal/top navigation bar on desktop (progressive disclosure: hamburger only on mobile), making core actions immediately accessible and intuitive.

10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better structure using Page Slugs.

Answer:Bad URL:
www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9
For users: Query-string URLs (with ?id=55&cat=9) are ugly, hard to read/remember/share, and provide no context about the page content (e.g., what product is it?). They look technical and untrustworthy.
For SEO: Search engines prefer descriptive, keyword-rich URLs. Numeric IDs give no semantic clues, reducing relevance signals, crawlability, and ranking potential. They also hinder click-through rates in search results.

Problems:
Hard to read
Poor SEO
Not user-friendly
Difficult to remember

Better URL using Page Slugs:
Use clean, human-readable URLs with hyphens.
Example:

Original: www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9
Improved: www.shop.com/category/product-name (e.g., www.shop.com/electronics/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra)
www.shop.com/electronics/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy

Benefits:
Easy to understand
SEO-friendly
Improves user trust
Better navigation
